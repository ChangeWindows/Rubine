# About Rubine
<p class="lead">Rubine is a Bootstrap "theme" with the goal of bringing the Microsoft Fluent Design System to the web. We're basically a 3rd party Winstrap but better.</p>

## FAQ

#### When will 0.1 be here?
We're still working on it, these are the early days of this project. We're not even done with the very basics of it. So stay tuned, we'll let you know when the time comes.

#### Why isn't there any documentation on the Navigation View?
Both the Navigation View in "menu"-mode and "pane"-mode are still in their very early stages. However, the Navigation View in "menu"-mode (aka a normal navigation bar) is built on top of Bootstrap's `.navbar`-class while the Navigation View in "pane"-mode is an entirely custom component. While the menu-mode won't change much structurally as its structure is being dictated by Bootstrap, the same doesn't go for the pane-mode. We're still looking into making this easier and perhaps merging it with Bootstrap's `.navbar`-classes and until then, we won't provide documentation for it.

If you REALLY want to use it, this very documentation is using this component and this documentation happens to be open source. So go ahead and take a peek under the hood, you'll find an example there.

#### What license are we dealing with here?
That would be MIT. :)
